Goal:

I to take the minimax algo, and take the first input from the Ai and place
it on the board.

Issues: 

Currently the algo runs but doesn't place anything on the board. Why? because
the code for that functionailty isn't in the game yet. 

Fixes:

To make this possbile, I need to find a way to to take the first iteration of the 
algo and place it on to the board.
